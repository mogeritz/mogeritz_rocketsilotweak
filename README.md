# You want to be able to support a 1K SPM Base on just one rocket silo?
Then this is the mod for you. In vanilla, the complete cycle of a fully modified Rocket silo (4 Prod3 Modules in the silo and 12 Beacons with speed3 modules around it) comes out to around 61.5s.
Normally, this would prevent you from sustaining 1K SPM on just one rocket silo

## Introducing: Rocketsilo Tweak
All this mod does is change the base crafting speed of the rocketsilo from 1 to 1.1. This simple change brings the overall cycle time (loading, crafting, rocket appearing animation and launch animation including reset) to 59.5s, so just under one minute.

### Sustaining 1000 Science per minute on one rocketsilo? Easy.
